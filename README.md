# Iris-Classification
Classification of iris flowers is perhaps the best-known example of machine learning. The aim is to classify iris flowers among three species (Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica) from the sepals' and petals' length and width measurements.

The variables are:
sepal_length: Sepal length, in centimeters, used as input.
sepal_width: Sepal width, in centimeters, used as input.
petal_length: Petal length, in centimeters, used as input.
petal_width: Petal width, in centimeters, used as input.
class: Iris Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica, used as the target.
